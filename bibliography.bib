abstract="Shor's quantum factoring algorithm and a few other efficient quantum algorithms break many classical crypto-systems. In response, people proposed post-quantum cryptography based on computational problems that are believed hard even for quantum computers. However, security of these schemes against quantum attacks is elusive. This is because existing security analysis (almost) only deals with classical attackers and arguing security in the presence of quantum adversaries is challenging due to unique quantum features such as no-cloning.",

abstract="A multivariate public key cryptosystem (MPKCs for short) have a set of (usually) quadratic polynomials over a finite field as its public map. Its main security assumption is backed by the NP-hardness of the problem to solve nonlinear equations over a finite field. This family is considered as one of the major families of PKCs that could resist potentially even the powerful quantum computers of the future. There has been fast and intensive development in Multivariate Public Key Cryptography in the last two decades. Some constructions are not as secure as was claimed initially, but others are still viable. The paper gives an overview of multivariate public key cryptography and discusses the current status of the research in this area.",

    abstract = { A digital computer is generally believed to be an efficient universal computing device; that is, it is believed to be able to simulate any physical computing device with an increase in computation time by at most a polynomial factor. This may not be true when quantum mechanics is taken into consideration. This paper considers factoring integers and finding discrete logarithms, two problems that are generally thought to be hard on classical computers and that have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems. Efficient randomized algorithms are given for these two problems on a hypothetical quantum computer. These algorithms take a number of steps polynomial in the input size, for example, the number of digits of the integer to be factored. }
